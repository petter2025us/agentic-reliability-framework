# Contributing to ARF

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agentic Reliability
Framework! This document outlines how to get started, coding conventions, and
the workflow for submitting changes.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:petter2025us/agentic-reliability-framework.git
   cd agentic-reliability-framework
   ```

2. **Create and activate a Python environment** (the `environment.yml` file
describes a conda environment):
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate arf
   pip install -e .
   ```
   Alternatively, a plain `venv` is fine:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install additional tooling** (optional but recommended):
   - `pre-commit` for formatting and linting hooks
   - `pytest` for running tests

4. **Run the test suite** to verify the base environment is working:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/infrastructure/  # or `pytest` for everything once name conflicts are fixed
   ```

## 📏 Coding Standards

The project follows these general guidelines:

* **Imports** should be absolute and start with
  `agentic_reliability_framework`. Avoid relative imports.
* **Type hints** are encouraged, especially on public functions and methods.
* **Logging** should use the standard `logging` module; do not print directly.
* **Immutability**: many domain objects are Pydantic models or frozen
  dataclasses; if you need a modified copy, use `model_copy(update={...})` or
  create a new instance.
* **Policy algebra** and other fluent APIs should return new objects rather
  than mutating existing ones.
* **Docstrings** should follow the NumPy/Google style. Public APIs should have
  docstrings that appear in the generated documentation.
* **Tests** should use `pytest` and the fixtures in
  `tests/infrastructure/conftest.py` when possible. New files go under the
  appropriate `tests/core/...`, `tests/infrastructure/...`, or
  `tests/runtime/...` directory.
* **Constants** (e.g. in `core/config/constants.py`) must be validated and
  documented; add new entries with care as they may affect OSS boundaries.

Refer to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for additional hints about coding
patterns used in this repository.

## ✅ Testing Requirements

* Run the full suite locally before opening a pull request:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/infrastructure/  # includes core and runtime by default
  ```
* Aim for high coverage on modified modules; tests should exercise both
  happy paths and edge cases.
* Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for asynchronous tests.
* When adding tests that depend on external heavy libraries (PyMC, ArviZ),
  consider mocking those modules to keep the suite fast.
* The CI configuration (GitHub Actions) runs `pytest -q`; ensure your tests
  pass in the editable install.

## 🔄 Workflow & Pull Requests

1. **Branch naming**: use `feature/<short-description>` or
   `bugfix/<short-description>`.
2. **Keep commits atomic** and write clear commit messages. Use the
   imperative tense (e.g. "Add policy combinator tests").
3. **Update documentation** when adding public APIs or changing behavior
   (README, docs/**/*.md, or inline comments).
4. **Run formatting/linting hooks** (if configured) before pushing:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
5. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch. Include a description of
   the change, why it's needed, and any relevant issue numbers.
6. **Address review comments** promptly. Small changes may be pushed to the
   same branch; larger refactors can be split into follow‑on PRs.
7. **Merge criteria**: at least one approval from a core maintainer, CI tests
   green, and no merge conflicts.
