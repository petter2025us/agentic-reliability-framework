# ARF Infrastructure Governance Module (OSS)

This is the actively maintained version of ARF.
The original repository (petterjuan/agentic-reliability-framework) is frozen due to access constraints. All future development happens here.

This module provides an **advisory** simulation engine for evaluating infrastructure changes against policies, cost, and risk. It is part of the open-source Agentic Reliability Framework and is designed to be extended by the enterprise layer for actual enforcement.

## Features
- **Intent models** for provisioning, configuration deployment, and access grants.
- **Configurable policies** (region restrictions, resource type blacklists, permission limits, cost thresholds).
- **Cost estimation** with built‑in pricing or custom YAML files.
- **Risk scoring** with adjustable weights.
- **HealingIntent** output with recommendation (approve/deny/escalate).

## Usage Example
```python
from agentic_reliability_framework.infrastructure import (
    AzureInfrastructureSimulator,
    Policy,
    ProvisionResourceIntent,
    ResourceType,
    Environment,
)
```

# Define policies

```python
policies = [
    Policy(name="cost control", cost_threshold_usd=500.0),
    Policy(name="region allowlist", allowed_regions=["eastus", "westeurope"]),
]
```

# Create simulator (optionally with custom pricing file)

```python
sim = AzureInfrastructureSimulator(policies, pricing_file="pricing.yml")

# Create an intent
intent = ProvisionResourceIntent(
    resource_type=ResourceType.VM,
    region="eastus",
    size="Standard_D8s_v3",
    requester="alice",
    environment=Environment.PROD
)
```

# Evaluate

```python
result = sim.evaluate(intent)
print(result.recommended_action)
print(result.justification)
```

Configuration
-------------

*   **Pricing**: Supply a YAML file mapping resource type (as string) to size→cost dictionaries.
    
*   **Risk weights**: Pass a risk\_weights dict to the simulator constructor.
    

Testing
-------

Run tests with pytest:

```
pytest tests/infrastructure/
```
