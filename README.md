Agentic Reliability Framework (ARF) is an open‑source advisory engine that
simulates governance decisions for cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to
provide **provably safe, mathematically grounded recommendations**—approve,
deny, or escalate—when users request provisioning, configuration, or access
changes.

This repository contains the **OSS core**. Enterprise customers layer proprietary
enforcement and auditorship on top; the OSS code is safe to run in isolation
because outputs are marked `OSS_ADVISORY_ONLY` when enforcement is required.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern cloud platforms support thousands of perturbable resources and users.
Traditional policy engines devolve into brittle rule‑sprawl; naive ML models
either overfit or offer no audit trail. ARF bridges this gap with a
**bayesian‑compatible, hybrid‑learning advisory engine** grounded in clear
decision rules and open semantics.

---

## 🚀 High‑Level Overview

ARF is structured as a **hybrid intelligence engine** coupling fast online
updates with offline pattern learning. A simulator takes an
`InfrastructureIntent` (e.g. provision a VM, deploy configuration, grant access)
and returns a `HealingIntent` recommendation. Internally it evaluates:

1. **Cost** using built‑in pricing tables or user‑supplied YAML.
2. **Policies** expressed as composable predicates.
3. **Risk score** from our Bayesian engine.
4. **Semantic context** retrieved from past incidents.

These pieces are assembled by `AzureInfrastructureSimulator` (or other cloud
adapters) and produce human‑readable justifications.

## 📘 Quick‑Start Tutorial

For a hands‑on introduction to ARF, check out the **[Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)**.
It covers installation, core concepts, step‑by‑step examples, multi‑agent
analysis, and how to run the interactive demo. A live demo is available at
[Hugging Face Space v4](https://huggingface.co/spaces/petter2025/Agentic-Reliability-Framework-v4).

## 🧠 Intelligence Engine

ARF’s core innovation lies in its **intelligence engine**, which blends
on‑the‑fly learning with deep offline analysis and contextual memory.

### Bayesian Online Learning with Conjugate Priors

To update risk continuously as outcomes arrive, ARF maintains a
Beta–Binomial model. For each intent category the engine tracks success/failure
counts \(s,f\) and maintains a posterior

\[
\text{Beta}(\alpha + s,\;\beta + f)
\]

with default prior \(\alpha=\beta=1\). The predicted risk is the posterior
mean

\[
\mathbb{E}[p]=\frac{\alpha + f}{\alpha+\beta+s+f}.
\]

Conjugacy makes updates trivial and ensures the system adapts in real time.

### Offline Pattern Discovery via HMC (NUTS)

Certain factors (time of day, user role, environment, etc.) exhibit complex,
nonlinear interactions that are hard to capture online. For these we train a
logistic regression using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with the No‑U‑Turn Sampler:

\[
\Pr(\text{failure}\mid x) = \sigma(w_0 + w_{\text{role}} + w_{\text{env}} 
  + w_{\sin\omega t} + w_{\cos\omega t} + \cdots),
\]

where the cyclical encoding \((\sin, \cos)\) of time \(t\) captures daily
rhythms. The HMC implementation (via PyMC/ArviZ) learns a posterior over
weights; the model is serialized to `hmc_model.json` and hot‑loaded by the
simulator. The offline engine can be retrained periodically with new data.

### Hybrid Architecture

At lookup time the final risk score is a weighted blend of the online beta
estimate and the offline HMC prediction:

\[
\text{risk} = \lambda\cdot\text{risk}_{\text{online}}
 + (1-\lambda)\cdot\text{risk}_{\text{offline}},
\]

where \(\lambda\) is configurable (default 0.5). This hybrid design offers
fast adaptation and deep pattern recognition.

### Semantic Memory

Incidents are embedded using **sentence‑transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and
indexed with **FAISS**. When a new intent arrives the engine retrieves similar
past incidents, providing context and historical effectiveness data to boost
confidence and recommendations.

### Deterministic Probability Thresholding (DPT)

We introduce **DPT**, a novel decision rule distinct from Bayesian credible
intervals, frequentist p‑values, or fuzzy logic. It compares the posterior
failure probability directly against fixed thresholds:

- **Approve** if `P(failure) < τ_low`
- **Deny** if `P(failure) > τ_high`
- **Escalate** otherwise

Thresholds `τ_low` and `τ_high` are deterministic constants (e.g., 0.2/0.8),
making decisions transparent, auditable, and immune to the “credibility
paradox”.

### Cyclical Time Encoding

Daily and weekly cycles are encoded using sine and cosine transforms

\[
\sin(2\pi t/24),\qquad \cos(2\pi t/24)
\]

to give the offline model sensitivity to time‑of‑day effects without
introducing discontinuities at midnight.

## 🔒 OSS vs Enterprise

The repository you are reading is the **OSS** slice, which implements all
advisory logic and exposes the public API. The enterprise layer (in a
different repo) wraps ARF with actual Azure/AWS/… clients, enforces decisions,
stores outcomes securely, and adds proprietary safety heuristics. To keep the
open‑source core safe:

- Intent outputs are marked `OSS_ADVISORY_ONLY` when external enforcement is
  required.
- Cost and policy modules contain no cloud credentials.
- Critical constants (e.g. `MAX_POLICY_VIOLATIONS`) are reviewed by the
  security team.
- **Enterprise features** include audit trails, approval workflows, blast
  radius limits, and integration with corporate logging. Contact us for docs
  and a demo.

Anyone can fork and run the OSS engine, but production enforcement requires
enterprise integration. For commercial inquiries or support, please reach out
